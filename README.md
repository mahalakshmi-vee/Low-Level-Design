# Low-Level Design
* Low-level design (LLD) is the process of specifying and defining the detailed design of a software system.
*  It focuses on how the system will be built and how it will function at a detailed level.
*  This design provides the foundation for high-level design, which defines a system's overall architecture and design.
## Techniques Used to Build Low-Level Design
1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
2. SOLID Principles
3. Design Patterns: Reusable solutions to common problems in software design.
   
       1. Creational Design Patterns
   
            1. Singleton
            2. Factory Method
            3. Abstract Factory Method
            4. Prototype
            5. Builder
   
       2. Structural Design Patterns
   
            6. Adapter
            7. Bridge
            8. Composite
            9. Decorator
            10. Facade
            11. Flyweight
            12. Proxy
   
       3. Behavioral Design Patterns
